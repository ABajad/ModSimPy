    "When you start writing programs that are more than a few lines, you\n",
    "might find yourself spending more and more time debugging. The more code you write before you start debugging, the harder it is to find the problem.\n",

    "**Incremental development** is a way of programming that tries to\n",
    "minimize the pain of debugging. The fundamental steps are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Always start with a working program. If you have an example from a\n",
    "    book, or a program you wrote that is similar to what you are working\n",
    "    on, start with that. Otherwise, start with something you *know* is\n",
    "    correct, like `x=5`. Run the program and confirm that it does what\n",
    "    you expect.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Make one small, testable change at a time. A \"testable\" change is\n",
    "    one that displays something or has some other effect you can check.\n",
    "    Ideally, you should know what the correct answer is, or be able to\n",
    "    check it by performing another computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Run the program and see if the change worked. If so, go back to\n",
    "    Step 2. If not, you will have to do some debugging, but if the\n",
    "    change you made was small, it shouldn't take long to find the\n",
    "    problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "When this process works, your changes usually work the first time, or if they don't, the problem is obvious. In practice, there are two problems with incremental development:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Sometimes you have to write extra code to generate visible output\n",
    "    that you can check. This extra code is called **scaffolding**\n",
    "    because you use it to build the program and then remove it when you\n",
    "    are done. That might seem like a waste, but time you spend on\n",
    "    scaffolding is almost always time you save on debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   When you are getting started, it might not be obvious how to choose\n",
    "    the steps that get from `x=5` to the program you are trying to\n",
    "    write. You will see more examples of this process as we go along,\n",
    "    and you will get better with experience.\n",
